# Mobile-File-Explorer

**Overview**
The File Management System is a cross-platform application developed using Java for desktop and Kotlin for Android, designed to simplify essential file operations. It provides a robust, user-friendly interface to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functions on files and folders. With integrated GUI components like JavaFX or Swing, the desktop version allows users to navigate directories, manage content, and perform secure modifications. Meanwhile, the Android version, built with Android Studio, utilizes radio buttons, checkboxes, and structured prompts to ensure smooth, mobile-native interactions. This dual implementation enhances productivity across devices with consistency and intuitive user experience.

**Key Features
**This system offers advanced features like multi-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android), batch operations, secure file handling, and permission-based access control. Desktop users can create, rename, or delete files and folders with confirmation prompts for critical actions. The mobile app allows item selection using interactive UI elements and applies file operations seamlessly within the Android ecosystem. Robust exception handling mechanisms minimize crashes and protect data integrity. Both versions were tested rigorously to validate execution speed, interface responsiveness, and cross-device consistency, ensuring a stable experience under varying hardware and operating environments.

**Technology Stack**
The desktop version uses Java (JDK 17+), Java I/O for file system interaction, and JavaFX/Swing for GUI development, implemented in IDEs like VS Code and IntelliJ IDEA. The Android application is built in Kotlin using Android Studio, leveraging components such as RecyclerView, RadioButton, and SAF (Storage Access Framework) for storage operations. Backend logic ensures compatibility with file system constraints while maintaining UI consistency. The system architecture follows modular principles with separate components for file operations, UI logic, and metadata-based file searching, making the codebase maintainable and scalable for future enhancements.

**Future Scope**
Future enhancements will focus on adding file search and sort features based on metadata such as name, type, and modification date. Plans include integrating cloud storage APIs for real-time synchronization and remote access, alongside optional encryption for enhanced security. AI-based categorization is another potential feature to automate file organization. These upgrades aim to extend the functionality while keeping the core experience efficient and reliable. Whether for individual or organizational use, this File Management System provides a foundational tool adaptable to evolving digital storage needs.
